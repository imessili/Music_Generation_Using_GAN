# Music Generation with GANs

This repository contains a project to generate music using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The model is designed to create MIDI note sequences by training a generator and discriminator in tandem.

## Features
- **Wasserstein GAN**: Implements a WGAN for stable training of the model.
- **Music Data Pipeline**: Prepares and processes music data for training.
- **MIDI File Output**: Converts generated sequences into MIDI files.
